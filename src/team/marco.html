<p>Marco Forte has always known he would be a criminal defence lawyer. Growing up on the tough streets of Toronto's west end was in some ways the path of least resistance. As a youth he would often see firsthand the realities of how the police would abuse their power through coercive action and violations of our most cherished fundamental rights. Mr. Forte vowed to make a difference and to fight against corruption and injustice. Today he accomplishes this promise through his work as a criminal defence lawyer. ‎</p>

<p>Before being called to the bar in 2007, Mr. Forte earned his Honours Bachelors of Arts‎ in political science. Following this, he graduated cum laude from the prestigious Osgoode Hall Law School.</p>

<p>Prior to embarking on his formal legal education, Mr. Forte would spend‎ his summer days sitting in the hollowed courtrooms of the Superior Court of Justice, watching famed Canadian legal advocates like Edward Greenspan ply their craft. Mr. Forte was inspired by their persuasive articulation of the law, but even more so with their skilful and dogged cross-examination of Crown witnesses. Mr. Forte learned from early on how best to challenge the reliability and credibility of the police to expose lies and collusion. Today, having formidably cultivated his own cross-examination techniques, Mr. Forte battles corruption while seizing measures of justice for his clients on a daily basis. </p>

<p>Mr. Forte has diverse roots across various areas in the criminal justice field, including experience in poverty law through his volunteer work at Community and Legal Aid Services Programme (CLASP), the community-based, student-run legal aid clinic at Osgoode Hall. There, he helped defend disadvantaged members of the Jane and Finch community against all types of summary conviction offences, including assault, drug and theft-related charges. The relationships he developed with his clients at CLASP allowed him to deepen his sensitivities with regards to the unique trials and tribulations low-income individuals must persistently confront. Because Mr. Forte is a staunch believer in increasing access to justice for society's disadvantaged demographics, he accepts all Legal Aid certificates.  </p>

<p>As a result of his internship at the Crown Attorney's Office in his last year of law school, Mr. Forte gained exclusive insight into the inner workings of the Crown's office, as well as the politics and ideologies of state prosecutors. Like Sun Tzu, author of <i>The Art of War</i>, Mr. Forte subscribes to the theory of 'knowing one's enemy' as the key to winning adversarial conflicts. </p>

<p>Mr. Forte's persuasiveness when it comes to oral advocacy is proven time and time again by his dauntless ability to sway judges and juries alike to his clients' favours. His courtroom rhetoric was fine-tuned by years of competitive mooting throughout law school at both the regional and national levels, where he took home several victories.</p>

<p>Aside from the study and practice of law, Mr. Forte's other passion is boxing. As a long-time member of the Ontario Boxing Association, he is a boxer who has earned a sterling amateur record. Mr. Forte trains regularly, as the competitive drive he builds in the boxing ring complements his thirst for similar successes in the courtroom.</p>

<p>While at Osgoode, Mr. Forte was fortunate enough to work as a summer ‎student for Gary Grill, senior criminal counsel. The two have remained close colleagues and friends. Under Mr. Grill's direct supervision, Mr. Forte was able to work closely on two different murder cases before completing his second year of law school (<i>R v Scott</i> and <i>R v Allen</i>). Mr. Scott (who, ironically enough, was a childhood friend of Mr. Forte's) was accused of shooting and killing two gang members in a botched gun deal. Mr. Forte, together with Mr. Grill, was able to successfully defend against the murder charges and secure an acquittal for Mr. Scott on the basis of self-defence. </p>

<p>Mr. Forte completed his articles with a notorious criminal defence firm with a reputation of employing some of the fiercest, most loyal defenders in the city. Mr. Forte articled under the direct supervision of legendary defence lawyer Jack Pinkofsky, emerging from the gruelling articling process with a wealth of courtroom experience. Before being called to the Bar, Mr. Forte had already conducted over a dozen contested trials. </p>

<p>As a young associate working at the boutique law firm of James Silver and Associates, Mr. Forte continued garnering acquittals under his belt. In one well-publicized case, Mr. Forte made legal history as a court-appointed amicus curiae. Thanks to his assistance, the accused in the case became the first unrepresented accused in Canada to successfully defend against his charges of first-degree murder. </p>

<p>When it came time to open his own practice, Mr. Forte's reputation as a fierce advocate and seasoned trial lawyer made for a seamless transition. In addition to being an effective lawyer in the courtroom, Mr. Forte has earned the trust of a healthy sized clientele base through his tireless dedication to their interests – twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. He understands better than most counsel that navigating the criminal justice system can be intimidating for even the most 'experienced'‎ defendant. He therefore prides himself on providing personal and timely attention to each of his clients. He ensures that they are informed of every development and possible scenario throughout the criminal law process. For Mr. Forte, client communication is key regardless of the seriousness of the offences alleged. </p>

<p>Since opening Forte Defence, Mr. Forte has defended against all manners of criminal cases, ranging from impaired driving offences to firearm possession and trafficking cases, as well as various drug-related matters starting from simple possession to trafficking, production, and importation. Mr. Forte has also defended against allegations of conspiracy to commit indictable offences, break and enter, all types of assaults, including sexual assault, armed robbery, organized crime, and homicides - most notably, first-degree murder. He has appeared at all levels of court in Ontario and has effectively argued dozens of <i>Charter</i> applications for exclusion of evidence and stays of proceedings. Mr. Forte has enjoyed tremendous success for his clients despite the uneven odds they consistently face. He was once asked by a senior homicide detective after a particularly relentless cross-examination 'how he sleeps at night'. Mr. Forte responded, 'l don't. I will sleep once you can show me the system is no longer broken.'</p>

<p>Marco Forte is a skilled advocate who truly loves the fight, and refuses to back down. For Mr. Forte the practice of criminal law is not just a career -- it's his calling. He approaches every case with a view to absolute victory.</p>

<p>Mr. Forte is also very proud to welcome <a href='https://fortedefence.com/team/nadia'>Nadia Guo</a> to his practice and knows that her skill, enthusiasm and relentless desire to fight for her clients ‎will only enhance the quality of representation clients receive at Forte Defence.</p>
