                        <p>
                            Nadia Guo has been with Forte Defence since autumn
                            of 2014 while she was completing her final year
                            of law school at the University of Toronto’s
                            Faculty of Law. It was through her study of the
                            criminal law and its complicated relationship
                            with civil liberties that she found her destined
                            nook in the legal sphere. The unrelenting human
                            emotion and moral ambiguities that define the
                            conflicts in criminal law casebooks drove Ms.
                            Guo’s unyielding fervour for this type of work.
                            Her interests in outcasts dwelling at the peripheries
                            of the law, philosophical dramas, and transgressions,
                            be they legal or social, are aptly fitting. Ms.
                            Guo is now completing her articles with Forte
                            Defence under the direct supervision of Mr. Forte.</p>
                    <p>
                            Ms. Guo obtained her Juris Doctor from Osgoode Hall Law School, where she
                            completed her first two years of studies. She
                            maintained a strong focus on criminal law throughout
                            law school, exposing herself to a diverse array
                            of issues endemic to criminal justice. This included
                            courses on the prevalence of mental illness among
                            the criminally accused, the use of restorative
                            justice and other rehabilitative techniques rather
                            than the current over-reliance on incarceration,
                            the unique nature of homicide offences, and the
                            (mis)uses of scientific evidence in the trial
                            setting. Ms. Guo excelled above average in her
                            coursework, earning the Kenneth Gibson Morden
                            Memorial Prize in Evidence, as well as achieving
                            the top grade in the Law and Literature seminar.</p>
                        <p>
                            Ms. Guo gained exposure to casework from early on in her law school career,
                            volunteering at Osgoode’s Community and Legal
                            Aid Services Programme (CLASP), where she worked
                            on summary conviction matters and did routine
                            court appearances for low-income clients from
                            the Jane and Finch community. Her interest in
                            access to justice and public interest-oriented
                            law continued to develop during her semester
                            at Downtown Legal Services, another student-run
                            legal aid clinic at the University of Toronto.
                            At DLS, Ms. Guo achieved favourable results for
                            her clients, ranging from full withdrawal of
                            all charges, to peace bonds and absolute discharges.
                            Ms. Guo delivered personalized attention to all
                            her clients, and made it her top concern that
                            clients were fully informed of their legal options
                            at every step of the process. By working closely
                            with members of the community afflicted by socioeconomic
                            disadvantages, Ms. Guo gained valuable insight
                            into the unique challenges faced by individuals
                            from this demographic who come into conflict
                            with the law. </p>
                        <p>
                            Ms. Guo also gained valuable experience working in Canada’s burgeoning medical
                            cannabis industry during her first year summer
                            at a firm specializing in medical marijuana-related
                            cases. There, Ms. Guo grew acquainted with some
                            of the major corporate players seeking licenced
                            producer status under the Marihuana for Medical
                            Purposes Regulations.</p>
                        <p>
                            Ms. Guo enrolled in Osgoode’s Criminal Intensive Programme in her second
                            year and interned at Canada’s largest criminal
                            law firm, where she worked on complex files involving
                            child pornography, impaired driving, robbery,
                            homicides, conspiracy, firearms, drugs, and sexual
                            assault charges. She had the valuable opportunity
                            to observe different types of trials in both
                            the Ontario Court of Justice as well as the Ontario
                            Superior Court. She also watched appeal hearings
                            at the Court of Appeal, and through all this
                            was able to gain the rare privilege of gleaning
                            courtroom advocacy techniques from some of Canada’s
                            best defence lawyers. Ms. Guo spent her second
                            summer at a renowned criminal law practice where
                            she continued to garner familiarity with courthouses
                            across the Greater Toronto Area, while further
                            cultivating her legal draftsmanship and research
                            ability.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Ms. Guo completed her Honours Bachelor of Arts at the University of Toronto
                            in English Literature and Cinema Studies. Her
                            affection for literature (her favourite novelists
                            are experimental modernists like Woolf and Faulkner),
                            cinema (lately: Xavier Dolan, eternally: Wong
                            Kar-wai), and the arts in general serve as a
                            healthy foundation for the more rigorous and
                            disciplined study of law. Ms. Guo’s legal advocacy
                            is enriched by the poeticism of her studies in
                            liberal arts, as starkly demonstrated by her
                            mastery of rhetoric and syntax.</p>
                        <p>
                            Ms. Guo’s authoritative confidence and intellect drive her work both on paper
                            and in the courtroom. Her sharp criticism brings
                            a refreshing perspective to every legal challenge,
                            and her dry wit charms colleagues and clients
                            alike. She is outspoken about and denounces police
                            brutality, government corruption, and race- sex-,
                            and class-based profiling. Ms. Guo understands
                            that her legal education is a privilege, and
                            is unafraid to use it to assist underdogs who
                            have every odd stacked against them. Though petite
                            in frame and young in her years, her larger-than-life
                            reputation for bold doggedness will serve her
                            well as her career blossoms.</p>
                        <p>
                            Ms. Guo is fascinated by darknet markets, Tor networks, cryptocurrencies
                            like Bitcoin, and digital forensics. She hopes
                            to specialize in defending cybercrime cases,
                            and aspires to one day soon be known as Canada’s
                            leading darknet lawyer. This is especially so
                            as online black market contraband transactions
                            proliferate steadily. She is a strong advocate
                            of privacy rights and supports the increased
                            usability of encryption-based technologies to
                            protect digital privacy.</p>
                        <p>
                            Ms. Guo also unequivocally supports the decriminalization and perhaps even
                            legalization of all drugs. Empirical evidence
                            has shown time and time again that the war on
                            drugs and the criminalization of drug offences
                            has proven to be counter-intuitive, needlessly
                            expensive, and entails costly social damage.
                            Ms. Guo firmly believes that the problems caused
                            by substance abuse are better off addressed by
                            expert health practitioners, and not the clumsy,
                            ill-fitted hammer of the penal system. She plans
                            to focus her legal career on advocating for sensible,
                            holistic, and rehabilitative-centred solutions
                            to substance abuse.</p>
