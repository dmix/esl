              Teaching with us will provide you with a wealth of opportunities to learn about
              daily life in a quickly modernizing China. Our students will be just as eager

              You'll be required to teach around 20 hours a week with EIE, leaving you plenty of
              time to explore and learn about China, meet new friends, and engage with your
              new surroundings.
