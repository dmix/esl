Candidates interested in applying to teach at EIE should first familiarize themselves with their teaching obligations for the school year. Our students expect to be taught by professional, dedicated individuals who are diligent and responsible when it comes to leading a classroom. When you do decide to move on after your time at EIE, you will have experienced unique personal growth, having gained a wealth of valuable and dynamic teaching abilities that will inevitably enhance your ability to tackle future career endeavours. EIE teachers will have a rare opportunity to place themselves outside of their comfort zones as they spend a year or longer in a country experiencing rapid changes at both a societal and individual scale. As more and more Chinese families gain entry into the middle class, the more accessible educational programs like EIE become to ordinary Chinese people. Join us as we position ourselves at the nexus of academic excellence and community. Your time at EIE will be a singular undertaking that you will not forget.

The school year begins September 1st and continues until June 30th the following year, with a break from late January to the end of February for Chinese New Year. Teachers are expected to commit to a maxium of 20 teaching periods.

While EIE is an excellent opportunity for those who wish to expand their horizons by taking a working holiday, candidates are reminded that this is not the right experience for those who are only interested in vacationing and partying. Our students depend on you to meet their academic and professional objectives. Chinese students especially have a strong commitment to scholarly success, and expect their teachers to complement and bolster their own enthusiasm in learning a new language. Our students will respect you and the knowledge you can impart on them, and in return we require our teachers to respect their learning journeys. Many of our students go on to work and study overseas, and getting a competent handle of English is a necessity for them. EIE teachers’ first objective during their tenure with us should be to ensure that they provide adequate support for the students that depend on them.

In terms of the curriculum you will be teaching, before classes begin every new teacher receives an orientation upon your arrival in China. Your Director of Teaching Affairs (DTA) will orient you and introduce you to the class materials and lesson plans.
