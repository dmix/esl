        I worked for Education in English (EIE), on two separate occasions, at
        two different universities. From academic year 2009-2010 I worked at
        Yantai University in the Shandong Province. In academic year 2015-2016,
        I returned to EIE and was assigned to Jiangxi University of Finance and
        Economics in the Jiangxi Province.
    </p>

    <p>
        I truly enjoyed working for EIE. I find the organization is very professional,
        efficient and reliable. The owner is Richard Guo. In each work site there is a
        supervising foreign teacher called a DTA, who is the liaison between Richard,
        the other foreign teachers and the university staff. Though there are
        pre-planned schedules, curricula and depending on the school, lesson plans,
        Richard does not micro-manage the foreign teachers, which I thought was great!
        However, whenever I had any concerns that the DTA could not manage, I was able
        to email Richard and he was always accessible.
    </p>

    <p>
        But the best thing about working for EIE, (other than the students), is Diane
        Diao, Richard’s assistance and EIE’s go-to-person. Diane manages all the
        administrative functions with the foreign teachers, from USA departure
        preparation, visa information, airport pick up, medical, Residency card,
        banking, housing, transportation, payroll, touring and making sure teachers are
        properly acclimated to their new assignments. Diane is very professional,
        well-organized, competent, resourceful and friendly. Since she is so well
        versed in working with foreign teachers, she makes the cultural adjustment
        easy. She is priceless!
    </p>

    <p>
        I have worked for other universities in China and have heard the horror stories
        about foreign teachers working and living in substandard housing and not
        getting paid on time. That is not something to worry about at EIE. Of the two
        years I worked there, I was paid either on time or early. Though you may find
        other universities whose salaries are higher than EIE, you will not find a
        better, more reliable and well-managed company. I like working for EIE so much
        that I have referred several people to teach there and a few of my friends have
        been hired. One of my friends hired have been working for EIE for more than 5
        years. Had I not aged-out of China’s minimum age requirement for foreign
        teachers, I would have returned for another year with EIE. I must say, I have
        visited several EIE locations and my favorite site is Yantai. I truly enjoyed
        working there. I wish them much success and continued growth in the future!

      <i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i>
Hello!  My name is Clarke Cummings and I am from the United States.  I want to
tell you about my four years of teaching for Education in English (EIE) at the
Henan University of Technology in the city of Zhengzhou, China.  Being in China
has truly been a rewarding experience.  As a person who has travelled much of
the world, I can tell you coming to China really opened my eyes to the changes
taking place here.  However, let’s talk a little about what’s it like to work
for EIE.  Most contracts run a 20-hour work-week meaning you have plenty of
free time to prepare for classes or meet with students outside of class.
    </p>

    <p>
 A typical class size is around 30 students.  What you teach ranges from
 writing to reading, conversational English for Freshmen and Sophomore students
 (typically non-English majors), and speaking classes for non-English and
 English/Translation majors.  Occasionally, the university will ask us to teach
 an US Overview or Speaking-Listening-Viewing classes.  The wonderful part of
 teaching for EIE are the students.  In many cases, you will be the first
 foreign teacher they’ll have had; therefore, you both are experiencing
 something new and exciting.  The students are very courteous and respectful,
 which is different than, say, North American schools.
    </p>

    <p>
Zhengzhou is located in Central China in the Henan Province.  What makes this
unique is the city is a major rail hub with bullet trains going in every
direction, so travel in and around China is a snap.  Zhengzhou also boasts a
major airport so flights into/out of Zhengzhou are easy.  Because China
celebrates many different types of holidays, there are plenty of opportunities
for travel.
    </p>

    <p>
Again, working with and for EIE has been a wonderful experience as we have a
great working relationship with the College of Foreign Languages directed by
Dean Ma and her staff.  If you’re looking for a change in life, want to travel
more, bored with your current job, or seeking new opportunities, please look to
EIE to furnish you with employment and an exciting career teaching in China.
    </p>

    The philosopher speaks of how water flows over rocks and around bends in order to arrive at its destination, an outlet.  The stream moves effortlessly along a path, never arrested by the obstructions -- at times, speeding up or slowing down.

    As teachers, this analogy describes our work. Our goal is to create successful learning opportunities for our language students in spite of the challenges and obstacles, and we do this most successfully as a team. We confront the problems with the common support of experienced colleagues on our team
    </p>

    <p>
    The classroom teaching of English as a foreign language has become a second career for me after retiring from four decades in the international health and development sector.  I was scared, at first, but I built confidence with the support of Education in English (EIE) in China.
    </p>

    <p>
    EIE provides you with a diverse network of professionals who assist you to achieve success and accomplish your teaching goals and those of the organization. Your team will include fellow teachers – some with more experience than you, perhaps some with less – and an administrative and recruiting network that provides daily and ongoing support.
    </p>

    <p>
    Unlike some learning centers where you may feel like you’re on your own, EIE has a web of professionals who are your colleagues and your backup. The administrative and office staff, along with your Director of Teaching Affairs (classroom teachers themselves), show you respect for the frontline educator you are. You will experience open communication in an organization that values participatory management. Your ideas matter!
    </p>

    <p>
    Teaching with EIE in China provides you with the full resources of university settings.  You will experience the prestige of being an advocate for Chinese students who work tirelessly to achieve their short-term and long-term educational and professional goals. You’ll enjoy classroom and extra-curricular time with students, maximizing their opportunities to use their English skills. They’ll become your friends.
    </p>

    <p>
    Teaching with EIE in China is not simply a job; it’s a challenge you will happily take on with passion. The gratification is endless as you experience your professional career develop and as you nurture lasting friendships.

      Making the decision to come to China to teach for E.I.E. in Yantai was a good one. I knew that I wanted to have the experience of traveling to a new country and to experience the culture, learn the language, and to teach at a University. It has been an even greater experience than I had hoped.
    </p>

    <p>
    Currently, I am teaching at EIE of Shandong Technology and Business University in Yantai, China. Yantai is one of the most beautiful cities in China. It is close to the sea and offers a small town feel with all the amenities of a metropolitan city.
    </p>

    <p>
    Teaching at the University here in Yantai has been an amazing experience. The students are inspiring and the program has provided an incredibly rewarding teaching experience.  The programs are both student based and teacher oriented.
    </p>

    <p>
    Teaching for E.I.E. in Yantai, I have a very low cost of living, I am within walking distance to work, have great in-country support, free internet, free electricity, low-cost quality food on campus, and teacher apartments are maintained at no expense. Also, as E.I.E. teachers, we have a paid winter holiday (up to 7 weeks!) and 2-year contracts are available. Importantly, the E.I.E. program also offers mentoring and training for new teachers, like myself.
    </p>

    <p>
    I cannot say enough good things about my experience with E.I.E., Yantai, and China. It has been an amazing experience and I am glad to say that I have extended my contract for another year. I look forward to teaching with E.I.E. and continuing my adventure in China.    <p>

      I’m Jamie and I am currently in my second year of teaching for EIE in Yantai
      and it has been a very positive experience teaching undergraduate and
      university teachers at Shandong Technology and Business University.  I highly
      recommend EIE as a school to work for. This is because of the excellent in
      country support such as helping new teachers to set up a bank account, buying
      a mobile phone and an orientation around the university and Yantai.
      Teachers also enjoy a professional and supportive work environment.
    </p>

    <p>
     EIE offers its students a verity of subjects and I have been able to teach
     different subjects including IELTS, College English, pronunciation and
     idioms makes teaching a pleasure.  Having an academic background in
     history I have really enjoyed teaching history, world cultures and
     literature.  To teach these courses we are provided with high quality
     books.  Furthermore, in the office we each have a computer and access to a
     printer.  The classrooms are all fully equipped with blackboards, computer
     and a projector.  As an experienced teacher I have mentored new teachers
     on how to maintain their grade book, set assignments and classroom
     management.  I am also the lead history teacher and I work with the
     history team to write exams and home work assignments.  EIE also offers
     teachers the opportunity to become DTA and manage a team of teachers.
    </p>

    <p>
    I enjoy a very low cost of living on campus as I am provided with a free
    apartment and Wi-Fi as well as being walking distance from the teaching
    building and canteen.  This provides teachers with an excellent opportunity to
    save money.  From where I am living I am also walking distance to a mountain,
    the beach and many shopping malls.  On and off campus we have access to sports
    facilities, gyms, martial arts and may cafes and restaurants.   Yantai has many
    wonderful Chinese and Korean restaurants.
    </p>

    <p>
    There are many advantages to working at EIE such as free Chinese classes
    and a long paid winter holiday up to 6 or 7 weeks.  I have used my holidays
    to travel around China, Korea, Japan and to go to Kung Fu school. While
    many of my friends have travelled around South East Asia.

        I was a teacher with EIE from 2014-2017 in Zhengzhou at EIE’s Henan University of
        Technology campus. I’d like to share with you some of my experiences and why I
        chose to stick with EIE for three years.
    </p>

    <p>
    Firstly, I really liked the structure. I liked that my pay always came on the tenth without any hassle. I liked that it was run by a director (mine was from Canada) who had experience managing Western employees. I also enjoyed the relationship the university had with its students. We held competitions and English corners, and through those as well as in my classroom I had a chance to interact with excellent
    and eager students.
    </p>

    <p>
    Also, 2014 was my first year in China and I was still relatively new to teaching. The textbooks we used were pretty straight-forward and helpful, but what I really liked were the students. I was blown away by how warm-hearted and respectful they were. Of course, there are always exceptions over the years, but the students are one of the main reasons I stuck around.
    </p>

    <p>
    Finally, I really like the friends I made. Each year, there were between 13 and 15 of us working together. We all lived in the same apartment building (with our own apartments, of course), and we all shared an office together. The office environment was always lively and fun, and my colleagues quickly became my friends. Even though we have already left, we still keep in touch and meet up over the holidays if possible.
    </p>

    <p>
    All in all, EIE was good to me. It was a positive experience that I will always remember, and is a company that I can recommend in good conscience.”

          I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to teach in China.  It
    has been one of my most satisfying experiences.  I love my students and I had a
    good time with them.  I hope they benefited and grew in their English skills.
