<p>Education in English (EIE) is an English program based in China that aims to provide Chinese students with the English speaking, writing, and comprehension skills they need in an increasingly globalized world. The program was first established in 1988 in Toronto, Canada, at a time when China was just beginning to open its doors to the West after decades of seclusion during the Cultural Revolution. The founders of the company recognized the importance of learning English for Chinese students looking to expand their career opportunities both within China and on the international stage.
</p>

<p>
EIE emphasizes the significance of employing native English speakers to teach our students, and has always implemented a strict policy of only hiring native speakers of English, or those who grew up in an English-speaking country before the age of 13. This is because EIE believes students not only learn proper pronunciation and cadence more accurately from native speakers, but also because immersing students in classes where they must communicate in English with their instructors better prepares them for real-life encounters where they are expected to speak English. 
</p>

<p>
EIE seeks to foster experiences where teachers from abroad are recruited not only for their strong handle of the English language, but also for their passion and curiosity about Chinese culture and history. The EIE teaching experience is thought of best as a cultural exchange between ambassadors, where individuals hailing from diverse backgrounds can come together and learn from each other. Our teachers often come away from the EIE teaching experience having learned just as much from our students as the students have learned from our teachers. The EIE teaching experience is an excellent opportunity for dedicated and passionate individuals who are unafraid to immerse themselves in a new environment, to take on new challenges, and learn about themselves in the process of sharing knowledge with others. 
</p>

<p>
In 1988, the first EIE program opened in Shijiazhuang in Hebei province. Since it was first established 30 years ago, EIE continues to play an integral role in furnishing thousands of Chinese youth with the language tools they need to succeed in today’s workplace. Increasingly, employers both within China and without see English language ability as an important asset, and EIE has been instrumental in helping young Chinese succeed above and beyond in this regard. The EIE program has come a long way in the past three decades, beginning as one of the only English language programs in China at its inception. EIE has been licenced by the State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs of the People’s Republic of China to offer total English immersion classes. The Chinese government has recognized the quality and reputation of EIE’s language programs, and EIE’s programs are officially recognized and credited by top since 2000. Students who complete over 560 hours of EIE courses are eligible to study abroad at a foreign university or college and have those course credits accepted by their home universities. 
</p>

<p>
EIE’s program itself has grown in size over the years, and currently operates in six cities, ten campuses across China in partnership with universities all across the country. Its standards of excellence and academic success has earned it an unrivaled reputation in China and beyond. The bonds of friendship built between our staff and our students have at times lasted generations, and the connections you make during your tenure with us will often last a lifetime.
</p>

<p>
The program EIE supplements English skills the students may have learned in middle school and high school before beginning at EIE, with the average age of our students ranging from 17 to 25 years old. In addition to learning to speak, read, write, and understand English, EIE also provides classes that teach subjects like world cultures, geography, business, finance, and economics. 
</p>

<p>
Many of our teachers are recruited from Canada and the US, but teachers join us from all around the globe, including from the UK, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. We strive to adhere to excellent teaching standards by recruiting only credentialed candidates with prior teaching experience. We pride ourselves on our diverse teaching staff, hiring people with varied skills and specialties in order to create comprehensive and adaptable teaching teams. Many of our teachers opt to stay on with us for several continuous years due to the positive learning environment cultivated at EIE. Through their work together, EIE fosters lifelong connections between our staff and our students, creating meaningful friendships that span over continents.
