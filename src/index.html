                            <h3>Criminal Defence</h3>
                            <h2>Service<span>s</span></h2>
                            <p>Forte Defence is led by Marco Forte, a seasoned
                                criminal defence lawyer who is there for
                                you when your back is against the ropes.
                                We provide unpretentious legal services for
                                those looking for an attentive and personalized
                                approach to their criminal cases. What sets
                                us apart from the fold is not only our patience,
                                our expertise, and our impeccable knowledge
                                of the law, but more simply, it is our recognition
                                that our clients deserve dignity.</p>

                            <img src='/img/FD_3sq.jpg' class='article-img'>
                            <p>We are a progressive criminal defence firm that
                                is well attuned to the various disadvantages
                                that plague individuals caught up in the
                                criminal justice system. While it is true
                                that the law treats all accused as innocent
                                until proven guilty, it’s not surprising
                                for those charged with offences to face unfortunate
                                stigmas. We are aware of these challenges
                                in the law, and it is why we are fearless
                                in our use of the Constitution as a shield
                                to protect you from injustice.
                            </p>

                            <p>The strength of Mr. Forte’s team is not limited
                                to our commanding presence in the courtroom,
                                but is also demonstrated by the compelling
                                advocacy we engage in beyond the trial stand.
                                This includes negotiating with police and
                                Crown counsel alike to attain unparalleled
                                outcomes for you. Our objective is to help
                                you regain your footing so you can eventually
                                move past this difficult period of your life.</p>

                            <p>Though you may have been accused of committing
                                a criminal offence, we at Forte Defence understand
                                how the story is never black and white. Getting
                                arrested and charged with a crime can be
                                a confusing and harrowing experience. An
                                individual alone is often no match against
                                the vast resources of the police and the
                                state. It is therefore important that you
                                have competent criminal defence counsel on
                                your side in order to protect your legal
                                rights to their fullest extent. It is also
                                crucial that we preserve your opportunity
                                to tell an impartial court your side of the
                                story.
                            </p>
